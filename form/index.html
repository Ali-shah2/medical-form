                                            disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others or would
                                            be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information

                                            laws as the jurisdiction where our servers are located, we will treat your

                                            time by posting a notice on the Site that we are changing our Privacy
                                            Policy. If the manner in which we use personal information changes, Company
                                            will notify Users by: (a) sending the modified policy to our Users via

                                            state and federal law. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use
                                            your information in this different manner and we will only use your
                                            information in this different manner where you opt-in to such use.</p>

                                        <p>ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
                                            Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of this website,
                                            including any related calls texts or other communications, will be
                                            resolved
                                            by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert
                                            claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. This includes
                                            claims
                                            against our clients, vendors, and Marketing Partners, which are third
                                            party
                                            beneficiaries of this arbitration agreement. The Federal Arbitration Act
                                            and
                                            federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.</p>
                                        <p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an
                                            arbitration
                                            award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual
                                            basis
                                            the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and
                                            declaratory
                                            relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these terms
                                            as a
                                            court would.</p>
                                        <p>The arbitration may be conducted by the American Arbitration Association
                                            (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for
                                            Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at <a

                                            1-800-778-7879.
                                            You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on
                                            written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at
                                            another
                                            mutually agreed location.</p>
                                        <p>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted
                                            only
                                            on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or
                                            representative
                                            action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in
                                            arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree
                                            that
                                            you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse
                                            of
                                            intellectual property rights.</p>
